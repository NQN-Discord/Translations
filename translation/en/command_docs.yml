      Create a sticker from a file
      Upload an image and use this command to turn it into a sticker.
      The sticker's name is determined by the filename, or what you type in. `sticker create BluePat.png` for example.
      Sticker names are unique across NQN, once a name is taken, it's gone.
      Stickers can be a maximum of 8MB large, and names can only be alphanumeric.
      Stickers need a file extension, which is also alphanumeric.

      Or by searching through emotes NQN has.
