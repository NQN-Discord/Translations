          Currently, you do not have any mutual servers with NQN, aside from this one.

          If you want, you can [invite NQN to another server](%{bot_invite}) to gain access to it's emojis here.

          A pack is a bundle of emojis. After joining a pack, you gain access to the emojis it has.
        page_2_0_name: Joining emote packs
        page_2_0_desc: |
          To search for emote packs, use `%{prefix}pack search`, optionally with a search query, such as `%{prefix}pack search dragon`.
        page_2_1_name: Finding the emote packs you're in
        page_2_1_desc: |
          > `%{prefix}pack mine`
          This command shows you a list of emote packs you're currently a member of, including the names of the emotes in each pack.
        page_2_2_name: Publishing your own packs
        page_2_2_desc: |
          If you have **Manage Server** permissions, you can publish your own emote pack containing all of your server's emote packs:
          > `%{prefix}pack publish MySuperCoolEmotePackName`
          You can also make your pack publicly joinable with `%{prefix}pack set_public yes` to allow people from other servers join yours with the bot, without an invite.
        page_3_title: Aliases
        page_3_desc: |
          Aliases are just individual emotes which you give a name, and are then usable via that name.

          If you know the exact name of the emote you want to add:
          > `%{prefix}alias search :EmoteName:`

          If you want to look through every emote NQN can let you use:
          > `%{prefix}alias search whatever` (No colons if you don't know the exact name)
        page_4_title: Replies
        page_4_desc: |
          NQN allows you to reply to messages sent long ago.

          Simply copy the message link via Discord (the Share button on mobile and then to clipboard) and then paste it into your message, and it'll post the message you're replying to as well.

          If you don't want the bot to repost a message link, you can surround it in \<\>, and the bot will not repost.

          If a server admin wants to disable this functionality throughout the server, they can use `%{prefix}server replies off`.
        page_5_title: Masked URLs
        page_5_desc: |
          NQN allows users to send [Masked URLs](%{url}) as part of their regular messages.

          This uses standard markup, `[text to show](https://url.here)`.
          To send messages with buttons, use `[button title](button://url.here)`
        page_6_title: Stickers
        page_6_desc: |
          If you've ever wanted to send large images/stickers/emotes, you've come to the right place.

          Inspired by Telegram, NQN brings stickers to Discord.
          You can use them as you would an emote, except stickers have a file extension at the end.

          Each message can contain up to 10 stickers.

          You can create stickers with `%{prefix}sticker create` and upload an image file or by importing from Telegram.
          This is done with `%{prefix}sticker telegram https://t.me/addstickers/sticker-pack-here`.

          To search through stickers you can use with NQN, use `%{prefix}sticker search` with a optional search terms.

          To view your stickers, use `%{prefix}stickers mine`.

          Note - to use Telegram stickers, you must first import them to the bot. The bot does not do this automatically.
        page_7_title: Personas
        page_7_desc: |
          Personas allow anyone in your server to assume a given username and avatar distinct from their own.
          In order to use personas in a server, you fist need to run `%{prefix}server personas on`.

          To create a persona, use `%{prefix}persona register name`. After that, you can send messages as that persona by sending a message:
          > name: Rest of message
        page_8_title: Server Administration
        page_8_desc: |
          NQN is heavily customisable in terms of feature sets, in case some of them aren't appropriate for your server.
          Anyone with **Manage Server** permissions can change server settings with the bot.

          Here are the features you can toggle:

           • Nitro - `%{prefix}server nitro`
           • Stickers - `%{prefix}server stickers`
           • Replies - `%{prefix}server replies`
           • Personas - `%{prefix}server personas`
           • Masked Links - `%{prefix}server masked_links`
        page_8_0_name: Troubleshooting Issues
        page_8_0_desc: |
          In order to run correctly, NQN needs the following permissions in __every__ channel you wish to use Nitro in:
          **Manage Webhooks**, **Use External Emojis**, **Add Reactions**, **Read Messages** and **Manage Messages**.
        page_8_1_name: "Not Quite Nitro's prefix:"
        page_8_1_desc: |
          Anyone with **Manage Server** permissions can change the prefix NQN uses.

          The bot's current prefix for commands is `%{prefix}`, though it can be changed with
          > %{prefix}server prefix %{ping} ?
          This would change it to `?`, though any prefix works.

          NQN will *always* listen to it's ping however regardless of other settings.
        page_8_2_name: Auditing Messages
        page_8_2_desc: |
          NQN keeps a log of messages it reposts, as the original message gets removed.
          This is in case that someone changes their name and avatar before posting an offensive message, or otherwise misbehaves using the bot.

          To get the audited messages for the server, use `%{prefix}audit guild` or [visit our website](%{url}), select your server and then click on the cog at the top.

          Only users with **Manage Server** and **View Audit Log** can view the logged messages.

          An alternate approach which stays inside Discord is the Audit Channel, which can be set with `%{prefix}server set_audit_channel #channel`.
          Any resent messages will be posted there with their current username, discriminator and user id.
        page_8_3_name: 'Permissions:'
        page_8_3_desc: |
          NQN requires the 'Manage Webhooks' server permission to correctly function; reposting messages will not work without this.

           • To disable commands from working in a specific channel, deny NQN 'Send Message' permissions there via user permissions.
           • To disable reposting messages in a specific channel, deny NQN 'Manage Webhook' permissions there via user permissions.
           • To disable all interactions in a specific channel, deny NQN 'Read Message' permissions there via user permissions.
        page_8_4_name: 'Information Gathering:'
        page_8_4_desc: |
          NQN stores reposted messages such that users can delete them and for the audit log.
          Every emote in your server is visible by anybody using the bot and is searchable, though unlinkable to your server.

          Certain statistics about how the bot is used are gathered to inform choices as to how to improve the bot further but will never include generic messages sent by your users.
        page_9_title: Advanced Usage
        page_9_desc: |
          If someone uses an emote, NQN allows you to use it as well, but only if it's been recently used in the server.
          **NOTE:** If you've only just invited NQN, it won't know about any recently used emotes before it joined.

          In the case that you have several emotes with the same name, the following order is used:

          1. Aliases
          2. The current server
          3. Emote Packs
          4. Other servers you share with NQN
          5. Server wide aliases
          6. Server wide packs
          7. Recently used emojis in the current server
          8. Recently shown packs in the current server

          If you find yourself with clashing emotes, create the one you want to use as an alias, and that will override it.
