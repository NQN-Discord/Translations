    what_is: "What is Not Quite Nitro?"
    bot_description: |
      Not Quite Nitro is a multipurpose utility bot which allows any user to use Nitro emotes.
      We have an extremely large database of visually unique emotes which you can use in any server the bot is in with Manage Webhook permissions.

      NQN also allows automatic quoting whenever a user posts a message link, the use of masked urls in chat and stickers, which are full size emotes.

      You can invite me [to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?{params}).
